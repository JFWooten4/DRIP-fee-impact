Details the impact of an assumed constant $2 dividend reinvestment fee over two decades in the Merck DRIP.[^data] In reality, these fees were likely much higher in the past, as reinvestments additionally include a trading fee which has been omitted to keep estimates conservative. As of 2021, this equated to ~5&ndash;6 cents per trade. Historically, I'm confidence the summation of these fees was closer to $8 or perhaps even double towards the beginning of the investment period in question.[^kfine]

[^kfine]: Nonetheless, I'm keeping this conservative with $2/quarter.
